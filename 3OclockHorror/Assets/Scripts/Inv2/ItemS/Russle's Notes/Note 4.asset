  text: "Much time has passed since last writing these notes to help keep my sanity
    and the hallucinations have only grown more vivid. I hear it\u2026 something
    calling to me beneath the house. Something that has been trapped and wishes to
    be free. Trying to resist\u2026 I will not be able to much longer. I hope I can
    hold onto my sanity long enough to figure out what\u2019s going on. I am investigating
    the happenings of the *** area next. "
