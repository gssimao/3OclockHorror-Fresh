    did and enter this cursed place. Things wander these halls and heaven help you
    if they catch you. Should you ignore my advice and fall to your greed, then focus
    on moving(WASD) and try not to stay in one place too long. It might be worth
    your time to investigate things that catch your eye around here.(E) Finally,
    no matter how bad your hands shake, if you need to grab something, GRAB IT!(LEFT
    CLICK) \tP.S. be careful of the blind one, she is always listening. "
